# Project.md Template

Template for Project.md — captures project intent AND v1 requirements in a unified document.

## Template

```markdown
# [Project Name]

## What This Is

[2-3 sentences describing what this product does and who it's for.
Use the entrepreneur's language and framing. Focus on what this enables for their users.]

## Core Value

[The ONE thing that matters most to the target users. If everything else fails, this must work.
One sentence that drives prioritization when tradeoffs arise.]

## Target Users

[Who are the customers/users who will use this application? Be specific about:
- Who they are (demographics, roles, characteristics)
- What problem they face that this app solves
- What they're trying to accomplish]

## Context

[Background information that informs the project:
- Why is this being built?
- What problem does it solve for target users?
- Any relevant constraints or considerations]

## Key Features

[Functional requirements for v1 — what the app should do for target users:
- Feature 1: Brief description of what it enables for users
- Feature 2: Brief description of what it enables for users
- Feature 3: Brief description of what it enables for users]

## User Flows

[Key interactions and paths from the target user's perspective:
- Primary flow: Step by step what the main customer journey looks like
- Secondary flows: Other important paths (if any)]

## Data & Integrations

[Data requirements and external systems:
- What data the app needs to store/display
- Where data comes from (user input, external APIs, etc.)
- Any integrations with external systems]

## Guidelines

**What This Is:**
- Current accurate description of the product
- 2-3 sentences capturing what it does and who the target users are
- Use the entrepreneur's words and framing

**Core Value:**
- The single most important thing for target users
- Everything else can fail; this cannot
- Drives prioritization when tradeoffs arise

**Target Users:**
- The customers/users who will use this app (NOT the entrepreneur building it)
- Specific personas, demographics, or user types
- What problem they face and what they're trying to accomplish

**Context:**
- Background that informs decisions
- The "why" behind the project (problem being solved for users)
- Known constraints or considerations

**Key Features:**
- Functional requirements for v1
- What the app should do for target users (not how)
- Scoped to first working version

**User Flows:**
- Step-by-step customer journeys
- Primary and secondary paths
- How features connect from the user's perspective

**Data & Integrations:**
- What data exists and where it comes from
- External systems to connect with
- Storage and data flow requirements

## What NOT to Include

Project.md captures **intent and v1 scope**, not implementation:

- No technical architecture (determined during planning)
- No implementation details (determined during execution)
- No timeline or milestones (project management concern)
- No features beyond v1 (future scope)
